# QRgenix™

The QRgenix™ project is meant to provide a one stop shop for changing links (or anything else) into QR codes.

Started as an idea while creating a visual resume.

While other websites exist with the same purpose, this is a pesonal project to experiment with CI/CD methodologies and tools.
