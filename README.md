# QRgenixâ„¢

The QRgenixâ„¢ project is meant to provide a one stop shop for changing links (or anything else) into QR codes.

Started as an idea while creating a visual resume as I was looking for a project to grow my DevOps skills.

While other websites exist with the same purpose (Shout out [QR Code Monkey](https://www.qrcode-monkey.com/)), this is a pesonal project to experiment with and learn CI/CD methodologies and tools without getting to caught up in the development weeds.
